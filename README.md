# Data Visualization

### What is Data Visualization and why is it so important?

Data Visualization is one of the most important stages in a data science project. 
It involves producing pictorial representations that convey relationships among the represented data. This is achieved through the use of a systematic mapping between graphic marks and data values in the creation of the visualization. Although the key objective in data visualization is to accurately convey the data, aesthetics play a vital role too. 
A good visualization not only helps us in discerning outliers, identifying patterns and trends but also transforms  complicated datasets into a clear and concise summary,thus improving readability and understanding.

According to Tableau, "Data Visualization" is one of the most useful professional skills to develop. The better you can convey your points visually, the better you can leverage that information.

## Key Terms to know

### What are aesthetics?
Aesthetics are the graphical elements of a plot, and in data visualization it is a mapping between a visual cue and a variable. Examples include: axis position ,color,fill,shape,alpha,line type,size.

### Coordinate System
In geometry, a coordinate system is a system that uses one or more numbers, or coordinates, to uniquely determine the position of the points or other geometric elements on a manifold such as Euclidean space. 

Common examples include Cartesian coordinate system, Polar coordinate system, Geographic Coordinate Systems and so on.

### Which charts can be used for Visualizing Amounts

Most commonly used visualizations to compare amounts include:

1. Bar Charts
2. Diverging Bar Charts    
3. Stacked Bar Charts
4. Grouped Bar Charts (also called Clustered Bar Charts)
5. Animated Bar Charts
6. Dot Plots (also called Cleveland Dot Charts)
7. Bubble Charts
8. Heatmaps
9.  Waterfall Charts
10. Polar Area Charts (also called Coxcomb Charts)
11. Dumbbell Charts

### Bar Charts

A simple way to visualize the quantitative data of a categorical variable is the bar chart. The height ofthe bar is proportional to the quantity we want to visualize. They can be used for displaying data that are classified as nominal data/ordinal data.

They are one of the most commonly used types of plots because they are simple to create and very easy to interpret. They are also a flexible chart type and there are several variations of the standard bar chart.

Different types of bar charts:
- Horizontal bar charts
- Grouped or Component charts
- Stacked bar charts
- Diverging bar charts
- Animated bar charts

### Dot Plots

Dot plots are one of the simplest way to visualize single numerical variable with a 
modest number of observations. They are a great alternative to the bar chart and the power of these plots becomes evident on refining and they can easily communicate important aspects of your data to viewers. 

### Bubble Plot

A bubble chart uses areas of circle to represent the quantity of a numeric variable. It is a preferred when we want to represent relationship between two or more numeric variables.

### Heatmap

A heatmap depicts values for a main variable of interest across two axis variables as a grid and uses color coding to represent the quantity of values.

## Comparison

### Unimodal vs Bimodal vs Multimodal Data 
 The mode of a set of observations is the most commonly occurring value. A distribution with a single mode is said to be unimodal. A distribution with more than one mode is said to be bimodal, trimodal, etc., or in general, multimodal.
    The statistics that are estimated using the data is dependent on the mode of the data. Therefore a useful step before analyzing a dataset is to know if the data is unimodal/bimodal/multimodal. 
    
### Grouping vs Faceting
Grouping allows you to plot multiple variables in a single graph, using visual characteristics such as color, shape, and size.
In faceting, a graph consists of several separate plots or small multiples, one for each level of a third variable, or combination of variables

### Visualizing amounts vs Distributions
Although, both can be used to visualize numeric data; the purpose is a lot different.
  The purpose of visualizing amounts is to compare magnitude of discrete numeric data over time or any other categorical variable. Bar plots and Line plots are excellent ways to visualize amounts. The length of the bar is proportional to the magnitude of the discrete numeric variable.
